# TrafficQ-Traffic-Managment-System-4sem
This is a Smart Traffic Management System with integeration of AI that uses **traffic simulation, rule-based signal control, emergency vehicle priority handling, real-time web visualization, and data analytics** to optimize traffic flow at a junction.

This project is being developed in multiple phases.

---

####Project Objectives

- Simulate a **realistic traffic junction** with multiple lanes and signals  
- Implement **adaptive signal timing** based on traffic density  
- Provide **priority clearance for emergency vehicles (ambulance)**  
- Store and analyze **real-time traffic data**  
- Display **live traffic status and analytics on a web dashboard**  
- Extend toward **ML-based congestion prediction (future phase)**  

---

####  Project Phases

### **Phase-1**
- Basic traffic simulation of a single junction  
- Vehicle movement with signal-based stop/go logic  
- Initial backend communication setup  

### **Phase-2**
- Dynamic rule-based signal timing using lane density  
- Ambulance detection and priority signal override  
- Database storage of real-time traffic data  
- Live web visualization and dashboard  

### **Phase-3 (Planned)**
- Machine Learning–based congestion prediction  
- Advanced analytics and historical insights  
- Multi-junction smart traffic coordination  

---

#### Tech Stack

### **Simulation**
- CARLA / Traffic Simulation Engine  
- Python APIs for vehicle and signal control  

### **Backend**
- Python  
- Flask  
- Real-time data processing  

### **Database**
- SQLite (for traffic, density data, emergency events)

### **Frontend**
- React.js / HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- Real-time dashboard, graphs, and signal visualization
